          <p>On this stage, you have actors who deliver their lines. Each actor has their own set of cards with their lines written on them. The lines are spread out on the stage.
            Now, let's say you want to highlight all the lines for a specific actor. To do this, you simply need to click on one of the actor's cards. When you click on the card, all the other cards on the stage belonging to different actors will become un-highlighted, while the cards belonging to the selected actor will be highlighted.
            Behind the scenes, the web page uses JavaScript, a programming language, to make this happen. JavaScript acts as the director, listening for the click event on the cards. When a card is clicked, JavaScript identifies the actor associated with that card and applies the appropriate styling to highlight their lines. At the same time, it removes the highlighting from the lines of other actors.</p>
